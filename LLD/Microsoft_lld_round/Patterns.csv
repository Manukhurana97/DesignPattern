1. multi player game:  
6. The core of this round was a design task, implement a pod scheduler that assigns incoming pods to nodes given each node’s CPU/memory capacity and each pod’s resource requirements. The interviewer wanted a brute-force attempt first, so I started with a straightforward double loop. After establishing correctness, he encouraged optimization; I mentioned and discussed using a heap to efficiently schedule pods and resources. He seemed happy with both my OOP approach and the discussion on trade-offs. This round ended on a solid note.
8. In the third round, the difficulty level ramped up as I was tasked with designing and implementing a circular buffer, giving users the flexibility to define the buffer’s size. The buffer had to support both write operations like entering "HE" and then "LLO" to produce "HELLO" and read operations, where, for example, reading "HE" would return just the first two characters.The real complexity emerged when handling edge cases, particularly around buffer overflows. If a write operation would exceed the available space and risk overwriting unread data, my solution was to block the write to preserve data integrity. However, the interviewer emphasized a nuance I hadn’t fully considered: writes should be atomic.
9. Design Video Sharing Platform
10. Design an Airline Booking System.This wasn’t your typical “design a system” question, it came with some real-world challenges. I had to think through things like:The best way to implement flight search.Which database would be ideal for storing flight data and why.How to handle concurrent booking requests without any clashes.Managing the cancellation flow, especially since payments are handled by third-party services.And how to store search histories efficiently, particularly when multiple routes are available between two points.I really enjoyed diving deep into this problem. I walked through how to scale the system, weighed the trade-offs of different storage options, and considered potential bottlenecks. The interviewer seemed pleased with the system I came up with and the thought process I shared.
11. This round was a bit of a curveball. I was presented with a scenario where a user clicks a button, and suddenly, the UI freezes for one minute. I was asked to identify the potential reasons for this UI freeze and come up with solutions.I tackled both frontend and backend issues, discussing potential network bottlenecks, inefficient rendering, and possible backend delays. However, upon reflection, I realize I didn’t dive as deeply into possible performance optimizations as I could have.
12. esign: Transaction Filtering SystemThe task was to filter transactions based on customer ID, start and end duration, and other user inputs.I started by discussing the general structure of the system, using classes and interfaces.The interviewer later asked me to make the implementation thread-safe, which I addressed using mutexes and locks.After running test cases, the interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach.
13. Design Problem: Cloud-Logging System The task was to design a cloud-based logging system similar to CloudWatch Logs.I focused on scalability, data storage, and log aggregation.The interviewer didn’t interrupt much, indicating that he was satisfied with the direction I was taking.
15. This round focused on designing a&nbsp;bus reservation service&nbsp;for Microsoft employees. The buses operate on 25 fixed routes, with a defined list of stops per route. Morning buses only pick up from home stops and drop at the MS campus, while evening buses only allow boarding from campus and drop at respective home stops.Problem Requirements:Design the&nbsp;database schema&nbsp;to manage passengers, drivers, bookings, and routes.Design basic&nbsp;APIs&nbsp;to support a frontend for employee use.My ApproachDatabase Design (Key Entities):Passenger: passenger_id, name, start_stop, end_stop, date_of_travelDriver: driver_id, name, assigned_bus_idBus: bus_id, route_id, capacity, assigned_driver_idRoute: route_id, list_of_stopsStop: stop_id, location_name, geo_coordinatesBooking: booking_id, passenger_id, bus_id, status (active/cancelled), trip_type (morning/evening)API's:POST /register – Passenger signupPOST /login – Login APIGET /routes/{route_id}/stops – View stops on a particular routePOST /booking – Create a booking (takes passenger_id, route_id, stop_id, trip_type)GET /booking/active – View current active bookingsGET /stops/nearby?lat=..&amp;lng=.. – Get nearby stops using geolocationDiscussion Areas: We also discussed:Ensuring morning/evening rules via validations.How the booking system could handle seat availability.Designing with extensibility in mind (e.g., support for future evening pickups).
16. Then came the design round, which was probably the toughest round for me, question design an autocomplete system for bing. discussion how would you handle millions of requests, how to scale it &amp; how to ensure latency.
17.  design problem parking garage system.The challenge was to handle multiple floors, different vehicle types, real-time availability updates, and concurrency issues.It was a tough discussion, but I think I was able to show my thought process clearly.
18. He asked me to design a library system.
First I asked is it HLD or LLD that you want, he said good question first give me HLD then if time allowed we will go to LLD.
I designed it well, showed him what metadata we will need, took care of all the cases and features, took care of CAP theory, SQL no SQL, scalability and what type request client will throw to server
