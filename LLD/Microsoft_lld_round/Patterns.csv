6. The core of this round was a design task, implement a pod scheduler that assigns incoming pods to nodes given each node’s CPU/memory capacity and each pod’s resource requirements. The interviewer wanted a brute-force attempt first, so I started with a straightforward double loop. After establishing correctness, he encouraged optimization; I mentioned and discussed using a heap to efficiently schedule pods and resources. He seemed happy with both my OOP approach and the discussion on trade-offs. This round ended on a solid note.
8. In the third round, the difficulty level ramped up as I was tasked with designing and implementing a circular buffer, giving users the flexibility to define the buffer’s size. The buffer had to support both write operations like entering "HE" and then "LLO" to produce "HELLO" and read operations, where, for example, reading "HE" would return just the first two characters.The real complexity emerged when handling edge cases, particularly around buffer overflows. If a write operation would exceed the available space and risk overwriting unread data, my solution was to block the write to preserve data integrity. However, the interviewer emphasized a nuance I hadn’t fully considered: writes should be atomic.
9. Design Video Sharing Platform
10. Design an Airline Booking System.This wasn’t your typical “design a system” question, it came with some real-world challenges. I had to think through things like:The best way to implement flight search.Which database would be ideal for storing flight data and why.How to handle concurrent booking requests without any clashes.Managing the cancellation flow, especially since payments are handled by third-party services.And how to store search histories efficiently, particularly when multiple routes are available between two points.I really enjoyed diving deep into this problem. I walked through how to scale the system, weighed the trade-offs of different storage options, and considered potential bottlenecks. The interviewer seemed pleased with the system I came up with and the thought process I shared.
12. esign: Transaction Filtering SystemThe task was to filter transactions based on customer ID, start and end duration, and other user inputs.I started by discussing the general structure of the system, using classes and interfaces.The interviewer later asked me to make the implementation thread-safe, which I addressed using mutexes and locks.After running test cases, the interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach.
13. Design Problem: Cloud-Logging System The task was to design a cloud-based logging system similar to CloudWatch Logs.I focused on scalability, data storage, and log aggregation.The interviewer didn’t interrupt much, indicating that he was satisfied with the direction I was taking.
16. Then came the design round, which was probably the toughest round for me, question design an autocomplete system for bing. discussion how would you handle millions of requests, how to scale it &amp; how to ensure latency.
19. Movie Ticket booking system
