8. In the third round, the difficulty level ramped up as I was tasked with designing and implementing a circular buffer, giving users the flexibility to define the buffer’s size. The buffer had to support both write operations like entering "HE" and then "LLO" to produce "HELLO" and read operations, where, for example, reading "HE" would return just the first two characters.The real complexity emerged when handling edge cases, particularly around buffer overflows. If a write operation would exceed the available space and risk overwriting unread data, my solution was to block the write to preserve data integrity. However, the interviewer emphasized a nuance I hadn’t fully considered: writes should be atomic.
12. esign: Transaction Filtering SystemThe task was to filter transactions based on customer ID, start and end duration, and other user inputs.I started by discussing the general structure of the system, using classes and interfaces.The interviewer later asked me to make the implementation thread-safe, which I addressed using mutexes and locks.After running test cases, the interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach.
13. Design Problem: Cloud-Logging System The task was to design a cloud-based logging system similar to CloudWatch Logs.I focused on scalability, data storage, and log aggregation.The interviewer didn’t interrupt much, indicating that he was satisfied with the direction I was taking.
